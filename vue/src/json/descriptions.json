Until he arrived, however, this water world was pretty well left alone. OKuattrs discovery of valuable gems and radioactives led to the world being overrun by fortuneseekers. The Klingons, who were advancing in this region at the time, also quickly set up camp. Although they are now mining Havens valuable resources, they allow OKuattr to maintain his mines, taxing him on the profits. Visitors are welcome. The Lonid Sith is well known as the type of place that anyone can be hired to do anything if the price is right.^Havens primary exports are, of course, the minerals, most of which are mined from the seas. The second largest export is Sithian Rum. Imports vary greatly, but OKuattr is reputed to be always in the market for Orion slaves. Klingon tariffs are followed strictly, as their small garrison controls all trade on the planet.^As long as OKuattr cooperates with the limitations imposed by the Klingons, they let him run the planet.

Although they do not possess warp technology, they have been in negotiation with the Romulans to purchase vessels with warp drive. The Romulans, in turn, are very anxious to negotiate with the Lendissians. The planet is located quite close to the Klingon sphere of influence, and the Romulans are hopeful of exchanging vessels for rights to bases on Lendis. The Federation and the Klingons are also attempting negotiations, but the Lendissians are leaning toward the Romulans because of similarities between their societies. For example, the Lendissians adhere to very formal rituals in all their public activities, for which the Klingons have no patience at all.^Lendis Wavamm is relatively rich in radioactives, which are the main export. Foodstuffs follow a close second. The planet's most sought-after imports are medium- and high-tech items. Drugs and other medicinal agents are also in high demand. The land is all owned by the nobility, as are the manufacturing centers. Thus, although there is a large black market on the planet, most of the lower class have nothing of value to trade. To encourage trade, the government is keeping tariffs low. The tariff system is quite arbitrary, however; the Romulans, for example, pay lower tariffs than the Federation or Klingons.^Theft is rampant on Lendis, which has led to the formation of a large internal security force controlled directly by the King. On Lendis, most authority rests with the monarch, while the prime minister's main job is the enforcement of laws.

Rather, the planet is one large rain forest. The unique ecology of the Mraarda includes large, mossy trees, which soak up the water as it falls. The moisture is then used by the plants, with the excess sent back into the air, where the cycle starts all over again. The only redeeming feature of this miserable planet is that it is mineralrich. For this reason, the Klingons have been quick to send large numbers of workers to Mraarda to strip it of its resources,^To this end, the Klingons have turned Mraarda into a prison planet. The Klingon commander of the Work Project, as the Klingons call it, is the ruthless K'Zinh. K'Zinh was at one time an Admiral, in command of a large portion of the Romulan sector. In one of those all-too-frequent coups, however, he was convicted of treason by his staff. His past record is what ultimately saved him, if assignment to Mraarda can be considered being saved. K'Zinh runs a very secure planet, with excess guards used at all stations. There have been no escapes from the planet.^Trade is as one would expect on a prison planet. The workers grow most of the food needed. K'Zinh allows trade with non-Klingon sources, as do many of the military governors of Klingon-controlled planets.

He has invited scientists from the Klingon and Romulan governments, as well as anyone else wishing to settle. Passarra is also attempting to build a self-sustaining colony, and so immigration is controlled. There are fewer restrictions on the number of scientists allowed to immigrate, but each scientist settling here requires roughly 3.2 other colonists to support him.^Trade is brisk on Passara, the colony's exports consisting of knowledge, patents, and licensing rights. The planet must import items that cannot yet be produced on-planet, such as scientific equipment and power generators. Tariffs are non-existent, with some items, such as firearms, simply not allowed. The black market naturally thrives on Passarra's Dream.^The original settlers included the administrative group that currently governs the colony.
